# Neural_network

Neural_network as it's name suggests is a neural network, which I am teaching to play a simple game i wrote.

## About the project 

This is an unprompted exercise, used to further my knowledge about neural networks. 

## Technologies used

Programming language: Python
Libraries: numpy, pygame, pyTorch, random, timeit

## Instalation

Install prot_v1.py which is the game, it can work by itself. You can then install model.py which services the neural network. To use the model.py you need a .dat file with the neural networks parameters, which are at the moment random_model.dat and random_model_2.dat. These are just random weights and biases so they are not yet actually playing the game. Every line in those files has 365 values which represent the parameters of a network, and every line is another network. I am teaching them by selecting the best performing networks and "breeding" them with slight changes to a next generation.

## Capabilities of the program

It is a game with a neural network that plays it. I think that's about it
